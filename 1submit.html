        <p>Uproute would LOVE to feature your latest trip on our website. Once you’ve shared your trip, we will review it and upload it to the Uproute website. From there, you’ll receive an email notification, and voila! You are now a published traveller. Easy! You’ll be able to share your uploads with friends and family.</p>

        <p>Since Uproute is currently in Beta, as an extra incentive, we’re throwing in the chance to win a weekend glamping in Margaret River, courtesy of <a href="http://www.soulcamping.com.au" target="_blank">Soul Camping</a>!</p>

        <img src="/img/soulCampingLogo.png" class="soul-logo-big" />

        <p>We’ll be announcing the winners of the prize at the end of May. All you have to do to be in with a chance of winning is to use the link below to share your trip! Easy.</p>

        <p>Thanks for being a part of the Uproute journey, and good luck!</p>
