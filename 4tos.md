Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.

### 16. GENERAL

You agree that:

  <li>the Service shall be deemed solely based in Australia; and</li>
  <li>the Service does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Uproute.co Pty Ltd, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Australia.</li>
</ol>

The Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of Western Australia, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If any provision of the Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect.

No waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and any failure by Uproute.co Pty Ltd to assert any right or provision under the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Uproute.co Pty Ltd reserves the right to amend the Terms of Service at any time without notice. It is your responsibility to review the Terms of Service for any changes.

Your use of the Service following any amendment of the Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. You and Uproute.co Pty Ltd agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the services must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
