### Our Experience

I'll just start off by saying that 3 nights in Brooklyn is not enough...

We were here to shoot the video for my latest single, Ninja, which will be released on June 1st. Hope you will love it!

Loved the Wythe - gorgeous converted factory with views of the Manhattan skyline at sunset that blew my mind #wadaview

There are not enough meals in a day. Pancakes and bloody marys at Lodge were a breakfast staple. La Esquina patio was a great scene and St Balmain makes the perfect coffee. And miso-cherry ice cream. Yum.

Gorbals Rooftop for drinks and a spontaneous session bringing out my inner Beyonce. Thanks for the love, Brooklyn!     

Incredible talent (and divine scalp massage) at hair salon Ludlow Blunt.

Good thing I didn't have time to shop more, but I'm already breaking in my new sneakers from Kith.

### Best Bits

Brooklyn was the perfect inspiration for my video shoot with all its grit and street style.

### Worst bits

The imperial system of measurement.

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** May - beautiful spring weather!

**General Route &mdash;** I had spent more time on the south island so my time was limited on the north island. I went day by day but had to limit my travel to what I wanted most to see.

**Main Activities &mdash;** arts, rooftops, music, sneaker-shopping, working

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Lodge, La Esquina, St Balmain, Gorbals

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** sunnies, an app that converts imperial to metric, a cool outfit you've always wanted to wear but weren't brave enough to at home
