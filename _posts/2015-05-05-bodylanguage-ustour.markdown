### Our Experience

No better way to kick off the summer than at House of Yes! We saw magic that night and were stoked to surprise all our fans with a guest set, performing with our amazing friend and collaborator, Shawn Wasabi!

Headed south to Philly at about 3am, which we don't recommend, unless you've got a driver. Thanks Trevor! Yes....Grant's brother is our east coast tour chauffeur!!

Arrived to Latham Hotel just after 5am. That's what we call early check in. SWEET! Surfaced in time to have our favorite brunch outside of Brooklyn - Dutch baby pancakes at Dutch no less.

Played for a sold out crowd at Ruba. We're still grooving from the love.

Up early to fly to LA, running on adrenalin at this point and the promise that Ian is going to take us for the best Mexican when we get there, which indeed he does. So first we check in to the incredibly cool Mondrian Hotel which is our affirmation that today, we are jetsetters. Then we taxied over to Guelaguetza in Koreatown. They make better enchiladas than Grant, which is a feat.

We needed some fresh air so went to the beach for a stroll. There are plenty of beaches in LA, but our favorite is Hermosa beach. Good energy, gorgeous views, not too showy, not too in-your-face.

The dancing was insane at the show that night. Actually every time we play at Resident we are so impressed with everyone's moves. Great talent there too, with our friends from Huffy Ten Speed also keeping everyone on their feet.   

On to San Diego! Like out of country tourists we rented a camper van, packed ourselves and our gear in and began our mini road trip. It was the best decision we made! We blasted some of our favorite songs, put Grant behind the wheel and struck off on this epic stretch of what most west coast road trips are known for. We're nailing the hotels (and the credit cards) on this trip and San Diego is no exception. Budget boutique is generally our thing, and pulling up to the historic US Grant Hotel we knew this was neither of those. Even better was we were in San Diego for 2 nights, the first day for a colorful photo shoot for our next single, Really Love. Here's our runner up photo:

### Best Bits

Brooklyn was the perfect inspiration for my video shoot with all its grit and street style.

### Worst bits

The imperial system of measurement.

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** May - beautiful spring weather!

**General Route &mdash;** I had spent more time on the south island so my time was limited on the north island. I went day by day but had to limit my travel to what I wanted most to see.

**Main Activities &mdash;** arts, rooftops, music, sneaker-shopping, working

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Lodge, La Esquina, St Balmain, Gorbals

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** sunnies, an app that converts imperial to metric, a cool outfit you've always wanted to wear but weren't brave enough to at home
