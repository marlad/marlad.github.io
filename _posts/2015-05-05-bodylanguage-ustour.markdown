### Our Experience

![Body Language in Brooklyn](/img/bodylanguage/blstreetwalk.jpg "Body Language in Brooklyn")

No better way to kick off the summer than at House of Yes! We saw magic that night and were stoked to surprise all our fans with a guest set, performing with our amazing friend and collaborator, Shawn Wasabi!

Headed south to Philly at about 3am, which we don't recommend, unless you've got a driver. Thanks Trevor! Yes....Grant's brother is our east coast tour chauffeur!!

Arrived to Latham Hotel just after 5am. That's what we call early check in. SWEET! Surfaced in time to have our favorite brunch outside of Brooklyn - Dutch baby pancakes at Dutch no less.

Played for a sold out crowd at Ruba. We're still grooving from the love.

Up early to fly to LA, running on adrenalin at this point and the promise that Ian is going to take us for the best Mexican when we get there, which indeed he does. So first we check in to the incredibly cool Mondrian Hotel which is our affirmation that today, we are jetsetters. Then we taxied over to Guelaguetza in Koreatown. We don't know how Ian finds these places...

We needed some fresh air so went to the beach for a stroll. There are plenty of beaches in LA, but our favorite is Hermosa beach. Good energy, gorgeous views, not too showy, not too in-your-face.

The dancing was insane at the show that night. Actually every time we play at Resident we are so impressed with everyone's moves. Great talent there too, with our friends from Huffy Ten Speed also keeping everyone on their feet.

On to San Diego! Like out of country tourists we rented a camper van, packed ourselves and our gear in and began our mini road trip. It was the best decision we made! We blasted some of our favorite songs, put Grant behind the wheel and struck off on this epic stretch of what most west coast road trips are made of. We're nailing the hotels (and the credit cards) on this trip and San Diego is no exception. Budget boutique is generally our thing, and pulling up to the historic US Grant Hotel, this was neither of those. Even better was we were in San Diego for 2 nights, the first day for a colorful photo shoot for our next single, Really Love. Here's our runner up photo:

After the photo shoot we went to Blue Water Seafood Market and Grill for the perfect casual seafood dinner with a Mexican twist.

Indulged in a set of rock and roll at The Casbah.

Friday we performed at Hide Out. We played with the amazing and badass Motion Studies. After party at the hotel. Oh what a night!

### Best Bits

The sold out show in Philly. The camper van adventure and eating the second best enchiladas in the world at Guelaguetza in LA (second only to Grant's).

### Worst bits

Not knowing where you are when you wake up.
