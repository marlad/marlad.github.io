### Our Experience

![Getting ready for Splendour!](/img/Banoffee_Byron/banoffeeoutside.jpg "Getting ready for Splendour!")

What an amazing show at Splendour in the Grass! I look forward to this event every year and love seeing so many fans and friends there. If you haven't been before, you must! Here are a few of my tips for having a great festival:

- definitely camp onsite to meet cool people and not miss an artist!
- I've never seen anything quite like the Tipi Forest of all the music festivals I've been to. It's an incredible vibe and my favourite place to hang and perform
- the Splendour comedy club is brilliant and their bar may be known for handing out free drinks!
- I found out about Harvest Cafe in Newrybar this year, about a 20 minute drive from Byron Bay. Well worth the drive to get to this beautiful, tiny town with a handful of gorgeous shops and of course Harvest cafe. Sit on their veranda and shake off the festival!
- there are a number of great pre and post-festival parties around - I'm headed to Brisbane now!

Hope I'll be invited back next year and I hope to see you there! Watch www.splendourinthegrass.com
