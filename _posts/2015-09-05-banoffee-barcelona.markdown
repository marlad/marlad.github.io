### Our Experience

![Typical street in Barcelona](/img/Banoffee_bcn/calle.jpg "Typical street in Barcelona")

My first trip ever to Barcelona...to Spain! Felt like Melbourne with an accent ;-)  

I checked in at the beautiful Murmuri boutique hotel at about noon. Way too early for lunch in Spain, so I headed to the beach to touch the Mediterranean.

Had to go to the Sagrada Familia to judge for myself whether it's genius or crazy. It's a bit of both, but as someone who loves geometry and shapes, it's GENIUS!

Had tapas for lunch at an amazing place we stumbled on - Bar Mut. They invited us to come back after their show to their secret bar...

Freshened up, and then went to the surprise venue back at the beach. It was a really beautiful and intimate setting - part of the extended Sonar music festival.

Finished late but was so energised by the show that I decided to go back to Bar Mut. So glad I did, it was an amazing hidden bar and great way to end the night.

The next morning I had delicious brunch at Brunch & Cake and sped to the airport, praying for an upgrade.

### Best Bits

Feels like I did so much in just 24 hours, the fans went wild, the city is all about design, the coffee was so smooth

### Worst bits

That I couldn't stay longer.
