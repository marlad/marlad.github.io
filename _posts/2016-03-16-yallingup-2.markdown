We were after a relaxing time so instead of camping decided to stay in the fully serviced chalets. You can take your own food as you have your own kitchen and the BBQ facilities in the park overlook the beautiful ocean. Wake up, go to the beach, go to a winery for some lunch, then spend the afternoon back at the beach before cooking up a BBQ for dinner and watch the waves roll in, or head to Caves House for some live music. Pack sunscreen, extra beach towels and a good book. A great getaway for couples, groups and families.
