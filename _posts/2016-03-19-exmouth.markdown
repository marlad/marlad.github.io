### Tips for other travellers
**If you haven't travelled to the reef then I encourage you to do so as soon as possible.**  

It was my first trip and I was blown away with how stunning it is, pure paradise. Bill's bar was lovely and the food so fresh the fish was amazing and all locally caught. The only drawback is the flies so would highly recommend insect repellant in your suitcase.
