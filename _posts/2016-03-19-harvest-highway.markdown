### Tips for other travellers
**Take the back roads for a more scenic, peaceful drive away from the highway.**  

 Whilst some are gravel they are great quality, but also have soft edges, lots of trees line the fringes and there is wildlife everywhere so be careful. Two to three days allows for a very leisurely drive and you can see and do a lot with regular stops at attractions along the way so you don't have long driving stints which means less driver fatigue and a more relaxed, experiential journey.
