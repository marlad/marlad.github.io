### Tips for other travellers
**Consider what time of year to visit Kalbarri as it will affect what you end up doing while you are there.**  

It's beautiful year round - if you want to just relax at the beach summer is perfect as it's so hot. If you prefer being active and maybe doing some hiking or visiting the natural attractions such as the National Park, consider going mid-year as the weather will make it a lot more enjoyable, the rivers won't be dry and the scenery will be a bit more lush.
