### Our Experience
**I surprised my partner for his birthday with a camping trip to Yallingup Beach Holiday Park. They say it is the best located caravan park and I can't agree more.**  

Directly across the road is the beautiful beach that Yallingup has to offer, where there is yoga in the mornings, surfing and rock pools to explore. The colour of the water and the atmosphere makes it a beach you don't ever want to leave. There is a lovely walk from the campsite to Caves House which will take your breath away. Caves house is an awesome pub providing good food, decent beers, live music and pool tables; it's hard to find a pub these days with a pool table!!! We spent most of our days relaxing by the beach and then heading to the pub early afternoon and stumbling home after a lovely night out. I recommend also visiting Canal Rocks. This is something you have to see when you are in this part of the world and is only a short drive away. Not to mention the vineyards of Margaret River.

We had such a lovely time and look forward to returning in the near future!
