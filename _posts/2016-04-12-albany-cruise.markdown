**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** I had been forewarned about amenities breaking down and people getting tummy bugs, so I took a bottle of colloidal silver with me. Also as I had never been on a ship before I took a bottle of ginger tablets and took two with each meal each day and had a blast: no seasickness at all.

### Best bits & trip highlights

A balcony room overlooking the ocean and able to watch the storms and aurora over the Antarctic.

### Worst bits

The blocked toilets... Lol!

### My Experience

**Wonderful, full of ocean drama and storms,** and loads of on board things to do. Great service and the food was amazing. There is loads to choose from and I had pre-booked into pampering appointments. My teenager children were very busy the whole time.

For first timers, go explore... A ship has so many areas for entertainment and relaxation. The food, atmosphere and service are great!
