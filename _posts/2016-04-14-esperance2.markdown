**The Trip &mdash;** Four days road-tripping to visit Esperance Stonehenge.

**Duration &mdash;** 4 Nights

**Origin &mdash;** Perth

**Type of Trip&mdash;** {{ tags_content }}

**Group Size&mdash;** 2 people

**Trip Dates and Average Temperature&mdash;** March: perfect timing, not too hot inland and not too cold on the coast.

**Mode of Transportation &mdash;** Car

**Cost per Person &mdash;** Less than $250

**General Route &mdash;** Night 1: Go as far as Kalgoorlie and find somewhere to sleep. (Didnt make it, slept at Karale Rock campsite - awesome). Night 2: Camp somewhere in Esperance. Night 3: See stonehenge. Drive on towards Albany. Night 4: Camped at Starvation Bay instead - awesome. Day 5: Home via Hopetoun.

**Accommodation &mdash;** Karalee Rocks campsite in Yellowdine was wonderful. Flushing toilets! Would have been not so good during the day due to march flies and ants-a-million. Esperance Seafront Caravan Park & Holiday Units was fine if you like that sort of thing. Too many people, march flies, intense lighting, grumpy managers.
Starvation Bay - flushing toilets!

**Main Activities &mdash;** Beaches, Hiking, Cultural experiences, Historical visits, Camping.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Discovered that McGuigan Red wine is cheap, tasty and no hangover. Yoghurt and granola, crackers and cheese, rice and chicken, eggs and bacon, cucumber, tomatoes, avocados. Perfect!

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** Insect spray! Sports tape for injury helped Macguyver the tent when it broke... I brought too many clothes, he didn't bring enough... Gas stove was broken - Should check these things before the journey! Forgot to bring the remote for the camera for Night Sky photography.

### Our Experience

**Stonehenge is absolutely amazing.** Seeing it as it was supposedly 5000 years ago and to be able to walk around and test the accoustics, to touch the giant stonework. A highlight.

Cape le Grande is so beautiful, truly wish we could have camped there instead, had lunch there though, drove the Hyundai safely on the beach. The campsite doesn't take bookings and is very small - so unfortunately it was full.

60 km of gravel road to the rabbit-proof fence start. Pretty great. Found some great campsites for future visits, e.g. Masons Bay.

### Logistics
We packed the tiny Hyundai i30 to the brim with our bedding, camping gear, food, clothes. We had the Western Australian outdoor camping map trip guide and an iPad plugged in and ready to plot the adventure.

### Worst bits

MARCH FLIES, ants, the busy caravan park in Esperance.
