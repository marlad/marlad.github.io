### Our Experience

**Don't let the drive put you off!** Although it's the worst part, it's completely worth it when you're there. And if you're really into snorkelling, it's probably the best snorkelling in WA.

Exmouth is pretty small and supplies are limited so take most of the stuff you need with you when you go.

The marine life is incredible, we saw turtles and sting rays every single day (snorkelling straight from the beach).

Coral Bay is definitely worth at least a day trip, amazing place!

Don't drive in the dark because there are kangaroos everywhere! Literally everywhere; we saw 45 kangas in 25 minutes on one stretch and had to drive at 10kph!

### Best Bits

Best part was the Ningaloo marine park and the ability to snorkel from any beach. Kayaking in the Yardie Creek canyon was also amazing. They have specific kayak routes out to the reef, with buoys where you can moor your kayak and snorkel further out than you would be able to swim to. All the routes are available from the tourist information.

### Worst bits

Length of the drive... It was pretty dull! 13 hours of driving time. We left at 4am and arrived at 6pm. Pretty far out man!
