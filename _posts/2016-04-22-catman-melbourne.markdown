**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** April. Good timing, good climate for an English lady!

**Cost per Person &mdash;** $500 - $1000

**General Route &mdash;** We were playing it by ear! Just going off recommendations as and when we received them. Not overtly planned.

**Accommodation &mdash;** In a nice AirBnb in South Yarra.

**Main Activities &mdash;** Walking, Riding trams, Food, Shopping, Nightlife, Bars, Going to exhibitions.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Melbourne has an amazing selection of Asian food. And cheap too! We had heard that there was a great Italian restaurant down Degrave Street, but in the end we never actually made it there...!

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** I chucked everything I needed in my 60L Patagonia Duffle. Other duffle bags are presumably available but why would you?! Pack light and bring a light jacket for the evening! Glasses with no lenses could get you easier access to hipster bars.

### Our Experience

The plan was to have a long girly weekend in Melbourne catching up with a good friend from university. We had an awesome time exploring the city on trams and enjoying the nightlife.

I think the hipster 'exclusive' element to Melbourne gets played up a little bit when really it's just a load of nice little bars and restaurants. We had expected every night to be pretty busy although it seemed pretty quiet on a Monday night. But the cocktails were very good.

I thought I would love Melbourne and really want to move there but actually I didn't; Perth is just so much better! I'd definitely go back and do it all again because it was great fun.

### Best Bits

Catching up with old friends. The trams! I just love public transport so much and I especially loved the trams. I love seeing the city through the eyes of a tram! The food was so good, the eating options were insane.

Also we went to see Louise Dawson at a comedy festival one evening which was excellent. She's hilarious!

### Worst bits

Expensive taxi from the airport was a little bit annoying.

One thing that was disappointing was that everyone talks about the Laneways being amazing but I found them quite hard to find and navigate to.
