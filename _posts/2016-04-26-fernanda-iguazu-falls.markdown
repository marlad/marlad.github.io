### Our Experience

The first night we were tired, so we decided to stay close to the hotel. We bought a bottle of amazing Argentinean wine and drank it at the restaurant.

The next day, it was planned to visit the Iguazu National Park. The park was considered one of the seven wonders of the world, and it deserves the title!

We spent the whole morning walking around the National Park. And I have to say: one period is enough to walk through all the routes. It was a hot day and we were exhausted by lunch time.
It wasn't my first visit to the Iguazu falls, but the first time I was on the Brazilian side, and this time on the Argentinean side.

What to recommend? Brazilian or Argentinean? Well, it depends on what you are looking for... On the Brazilian side you have more of a panoramic view of the falls; on the Argentinean side you get closer to the falls, and you get to feel the power of nature more intensively! On the other hand, the Argentinean side is cheaper and the tours are longer! So, if you have time, visit both sides. It's worth it!  

After finishing the tours of the park, we killed some time rafting under the falls. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! I totally recommend!

After our afternoon adventure, we went back to the hotel to enjoy the pool. Later, we decided to walk downtown to look for a different spot . We noticed bustling outdoor sidewalk restaurant tables where people seemed to be enjoying themselves. However, we continued on to check out a few other locations before we said, 'no, let's go to the first one!'.

We finally found a place, and we were very glad that we did, the restaurant was called LA RUEDA.  A table was quickly cleared for us and cold beer and wine served up while we looked at their menu. The man serving us was quite busy but very friendly and helpful. We decided to keep it simple and go with the traditional beef steak accompanied with chimichurris... Oh man... It was the best steak I ever ate in Argentina. I totally recommend!

The next day we visited the Bird Park - Parque das Aves - This park is located on the Brazilian side of the Iguazu falls, and it's also worth visiting. A lot of exotic tropical birds are there, and you get to know a variety of them.

We finish the visit, and drove back home.

### Why we loved it

The natural beauty of the parks and the amazing food and wine on the Argentinean side, made the most of our experience!

### Drawbacks

Despite from the expensive beer inside the Iguazu Falls and the fact that you can't use credit card in Argentina, no drawbacks, actually!
