### Our Experience

Unfortunately I didn't have much time to spend in the city, as I had business meetings and a full day conference to attend. But, I enjoyed all the time I spent in the city.

The airport in Stockholm is big, but easy to move around. From there, I took a taxi and went straight to the hotel. Berns is a very nice hotel, the room is spacious and super clean. The architecture is impressive and the food.....Oh man, the food...Spectacular!

In the hotel lobby I've made some friends, and we went to a club. They were playing live jazz, and I went crazy. Fasching Jazzklubb is the best jazz club I've ever been, and listen: I've been in a lottttt of jazz clubs - JAZZ LOVER HERE!!

No photos allowed from that night..

The next day I had a conference to attend. The conference was taking place at the university of Stockholm. The university is a tourist attraction by itself and the library.... breathtaking!

By the end of the day I was exhausted... But as it was my last night I had to do something cool. I researched on the internet about a Medieval restaurant the I heard about - Aifur is the name - I called them and made a reservation for myself. I arrived there thinking I'd be the weird one, but I was absolutely wrong!

This restaurant provided such an amazing service that I though about never leaving Stockholm anymore! I was all by myself, so they placed me in a long table with lots of people who went to the restaurant by themselves. We drunk lots of beer and had an amazing food experience! This bar is different because you can have a real medieval experience. The plate, the glass, the fork and knife, the atmosphere, the clothes of the staff, the music, is all medieval style. Real medieval style. I won't tell you more, go and see yourself!

### Why we loved it

Stockholm is amazing; the logistics, the people, the food... I absolutely loved each minute spent in the city and everything what I saw.

### Drawbacks

I wasn't prepared for that cold weather, so the only thing I can say I didn't like much was the weather - sooooo cold! - Going for Stockholm during the winter? Bring an umbrela and a thick coat!
