### Our Experience

Well travel in India was very different that I expected. I really wanted to see beautiful temples, kind people, but no, I just found people that care only about themselves, they hurt animals for no reason, like sadistic people, even the cows that they consider as sacred animals. But worthy the experience, see a different type of live, anyway I recommend the country.

A high point of my trip, on a positive way, was when i arrived in Leh, in Kashimir, that place is amazing, with very very polite people, is very different of the rest of India (at least from the cities that I passed). And they are like that, because they are mostly buddhists, it is another way to live. Is simply amazing.

### Why I Loved It

The positive side of my trip was the countryside, hell of nice people there, very humble yet with very big hearts.

### Drawbacks

To buy train tickets, is really really hard to understand the way things work there, and the public employees, they dont like to work as well. So if you wanna go there, the first thing you have to do if you wanna travel through India by trains, is buy the train tickets.
