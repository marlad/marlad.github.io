### Our Experience

Was lucky enough to catch some warm(er) weather in Tokyo and got some fantastic days in the gardens and temples with the cherry blossoms coming out. Also managed to jag a few days of fresh snow on the mountain. As it was late season the slopes were very quiet, a few school groups around and other tour groups but basically never had to cue for a lift and had many runs to myself, especially early in the morning.

On the down side the night life bearly had a pulse, spent some nights in bars with 2 or 3 other people and not much going on. Very few English speaking visitors around, none in the hotel I stayed at, and I could probably count on 1 hand the number I met on the slopes. Did see 2 or 3 in bars at night.

### Best Bits

Love the food, the small bars and the fun nights out. The company helped a lot too.

### Worst bits

Can be a bit tricky getting out through Nagano to the right place in the slopes.
