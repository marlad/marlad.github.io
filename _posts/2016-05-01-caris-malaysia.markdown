**The Trip &mdash;** Day Hike to the Summit of Mt Santubong

**Duration &mdash;** 1 day

**Origin &mdash;** Kuching, Malaysia

**Type of Trip &mdash;** {{ tags_content }}

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** April. Choose a day where it's not too hot. We had cloud and mist on the climb up - nice and cool. But it perfectly cleared when we reached the top.

**Mode of Transportation &mdash;** Car

**Arrival Logistics &mdash;** Perth - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - Kuching by plane. And a car trip to Mt Santubong.

**Cost per Person &mdash;** Less than $250

**General Route &mdash;** 3hrs up 2hrs down - but it ended up taking us >3hrs down as well!

**Accommodation &mdash;** N/A

**Main Activities &mdash;** Hiking! Flying the drone

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Bring lots of water! 1.5L pp is not enough. We rationed our supplies on the way down which wasn't wise. And bring food too. Carry all your necessities with you and leave no rubbish.

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** Water, sun cream, right shoes, food, gloves if you want some padding when climbing up the ladders and ropes.. Oh did I not mention, some parts are 90deg up ladders... It is recommended you train or mentally prepare (unlike me!).

### Our Experience

It is recommended to start in the morning. We departed our home about 7.45am and got breakfast on the way (kolo mee noodles of course). Stopped by a petrol station for a toilet break (squat toilets to warm up those glutes) and buy water. A 30-40min drive towards the Mt. And the climb began ~9.30am.. Top reached 12.30am.. Stayed for an hour and played with the drone.. Arrived back at the bottom ~4.30pm very hot and sweaty... But accomplished!

### Best Bits

The view! Cardio and being in nature :)

### Worst bits

The length of the climb down and lack of water...
