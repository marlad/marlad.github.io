### Our Experience

![Jack in Antarctica](/img/jack_antarctica/2.jpg "Jack in Antarctica")

Antarctica is a trip of a lifetime. I could never forget the things I saw and the people I shared it with. The lack of noise and air pollution is astonishing. The wildlife is accessible and learning from researchers all about the continent and its importance to nature is really interesting. Costs can be saved a bit if you are flexible and travel to Ushuaia and wait for a last minute opening but I didn't have that flexibility. It's best to be on a ship with less than 100 people, otherwise you have to rotate and won't be able to make all the landings.

### Best Bits

It is one of the more unusual and magnificent trips to take in the world. The nature and wildlife are spectacular. Being cut off from the world for a bit and immersed in nature is relaxing. Met a lot of similarly-minded adventure travelers and explorers on board.

### Worst bits

That it wasn't longer. Having done it I wish I had gone for a longer trip to experience even more.

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** December - Travel to Antarctica is only feasible between November and February

**Arrival Logistics &mdash;** Flew to Ushuaia in Southern Argentina, spent a night there and a day visiting the area before boarding an icebreaker for Antarctica.

**General Route &mdash;** Two days of travel across the Drake Passage to arrive at the Antarctic peninsula. The trip was ship-based but making two to three landings on the continent per day.

**Main Activities &mdash;** Hiking, sailing, historical visits, wildlife, sport and exercise, motor boating, lectures from scientists and researchers.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Food was served in the ship's cafeteria. The food was quite good. Each evening they served the traditional Christmas meal from one of the different nationalities of the ship's passengers. There was a small shipboard bar for after dinner drinks and socialization.

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** Warm clothing - I purchased gear including heavy jackets, lighter jackets, thermals, water-proof snow boots. Dramamine or something like it if you're prone to seasickness.
