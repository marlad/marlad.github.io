**The Trip &mdash;** Weeklong endurance sport trip in Maui, Hawaii

**Duration &mdash;** 9 Nights

**Origin &mdash;** Calgary, Alberta

**Type of Trip &mdash;** {{ tags_content }}

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** March

**Mode of Transportation &mdash;** Aeroplane

**Arrival Logistics &mdash;** Flew direct from Calgary to Maui, rented a car and drove to Kihei.

**Cost per Person &mdash;** $1000 - $2000

**General Route &mdash;** We were there to run a half marathon, swim with the sea turtles, cycle up Haleakala, relax by the beach, and eat fresh seafood.

**Accommodation &mdash;** Rented a condo at Kihei Bay Surf.

**Main Activities &mdash;** Beaches, Hiking, Food, Wine tasting, Relaxing , Sport and Exercise, Watersports, Massages.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** Loved watching the sunset over the ocean while having ahi tuna pizza at Pi in Lahaina. Cafe Kihei for breakfast, and fish tacos from Coconuts were other favorites.

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** It was a triathlon filled training trip, so we brought a lot of gear to facilitate that. If going up Haleakala, bring warm clothes, it feels a lot closer to Canada than Hawaii when you are at the top.

### Best Bits

Maui was an awesome place to train in the morning, then relax by the beach, eat incredible seafood, and drink some ice cold Kona Brewing Company beer with the rest of the day. Cycling from Paia to the summit of Haleakala was an incredibly difficult ride, but a very neat accomplishment, that filled us with a bunch of great memories and stories.

### Worst bits

The worst things were probably a result of our own miscues. Buying the directed road to Hana CD for the drive, ripping it out of the package, then getting back in the car and realizing that it didn't have a CD player. Taking the car keys for a swim in the ocean, which left them not working, and us stranded for a few hours while we waited for a new car. Driving to Lahaina for a luau, to find that it was pouring rain on that side of the island, and that the luau was rained out.
