### Our Experience

![Jack in New Zealand's North Island](/img/jack_nz_n/2.jpg "Jack in New Zealand's North Island")

After spending more time than planned on the South Island I had limited time in the North so I picked the main activities I wanted which were very outdoors-centric. My route in one week was as follows:

1. Wellington and surroundings
2. Lake Taupo and surroundings
3. Rotorua and surroundings
4. Hobbiton, Cambridge, Raglan
5. Auckland and surroundings

### Best Bits

Whitewater rafting, helicoptering, sulfur springs, redwoods and Hobbiton.

### Worst bits

After spending time on the south island, the north can feel more crowded.

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** April

**Arrival Logistics &mdash;** Landed at Wellington airport, picked up a rental car and headed to my hotel in the city.

**General Route &mdash;** I had spent more time on the south island so my time was limited on the north island. I went day by day but had to limit my travel to what I wanted most to see.

**Main Activities &mdash;** Hiking, Cultural experiences, Food, Wine tasting, Historical visits, Wildlife, Watersports, Live music.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** After a month of solo and outdoors travel around the country I treated myself to a final dinner at Lava Dining at the Sofitel Auckland. It was a amazing service, food and wine to complete my trip.

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** Variable clothing for both warmer and cooler temperatures as you can get both in New Zealand that time of the year.
