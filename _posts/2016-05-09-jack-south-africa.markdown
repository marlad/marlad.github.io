### Best Bits

The Western Cape is unique. The scenery is beautiful and inspiring. The food and wine world class quality and the people diverse and friendly. Our activities included main sights, top restaurants and late night bars. Cape Town has something for everyone. I would return in a heartbeat.

We loved staying in the Clifton beach area of CT and also in Franschhoek and wouldn't have changed anything about our trip.

### Worst bits

Taxis can be frustrating and try to rip you off but fortunately Uber is very prevalent in CT and very high quality.

**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** October - We had amazing weather in October. Not too hot, lots of sun and cool evening breezes.

**Arrival Logistics &mdash;** I was traveling with a South African friend. We arrived at Cape Town's airport and were picked up by another friend.

**General Route &mdash;** It was my first time to Cape Town but the trip was a mixture of sightseeing, leisure activities and spending time with friends. The trip was split between time in Cape Town and time out in the wine country.

**Main Activities &mdash;** Beaches, cultural experiences, food, wine tasting, relaxing, shopping, nightlife, bars.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** The food and wine were a highlight of the trip. Knowing locals we ate at many of the best restaurants. The prices are very cheap for very good quality. We also attended many "braais" (SA barbecues) with locals. The food and wine in Franschhoek was also spectacular. We loved the wine at Grand Provence.

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** Variable clothing, warm days and sometimes cool evenings so a light jacket.
