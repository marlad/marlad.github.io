### Our Experience

![Dominique Round the World](/img/dominique_world/2.jpg "Dominique Round the World")

Taking a longer time of to get out of the hamster wheel, see the world and especially spend lots of quality time with your loved ones is something you should do if ever you have the opportunity to. It doesn't have to be a world trip, it can be something less expensive too. The time have, the moments you share when there is nothing else then you and your loved ones is something that will last forever.

### Best Bits

Many places where wonderful but traveling with a 4 year old, Hawaii and Canada in July where just perfect.

### Worst bits

Nothing was bad really but traveling the south island of New Zealand in April was just too late. It was just too cold, wet and dark to enjoy camping with a small kid.

<hr />


**Trip Dates and Comments &mdash;** April, May, June, July - April was too late to travel the southern island of New Zealand.

**Arrival Logistics &mdash;** Flew to Singapore, spend 2 nights there to break the trip and look at the city and continued to the south island of New Zealand where we took over our camper van and hit the road.

**General Route &mdash;** Get to our hotel in Christchurch, sleep, go and get our camper van and follow the coast heading south.

**Main Activities &mdash;** Hiking, cultural experiences, food, wine tasting, wildlife, relaxing, sport and exercise, watersports, scuba diving, camping, shopping.

**Food and Drink Highlights &mdash;** All kinds of food in Japan, fresh shrimps on the beach in Hawaii and delicious wine in the Marlborough region in New Zealand and Napa Valley in California.

**Essential Packing for this Trip &mdash;** We could have left our heavy hiking shoes at home - lots of weight and at the end of the day you will only use your sneakers anyways.
